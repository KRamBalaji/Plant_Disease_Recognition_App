# Plant_Disease_Recognition_App

This is my final year capstone project. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify leaf images to distinguish between healthy and diseased plant leaves with 85% accuracy.
Technologies used - SwiftUI, Vision, CreateML

Contribution - Individual

# Features - 
1. App starts with a Home screen having some articles.
2. It has a classify page in which we can classify/predict leaf images.
3. At last, it has an About section which tells us about developer info(social media handles) and also it has lock your app feature(just for showoff, nothing to do with the project).

Note: Most of the data used in the app is either dummy data or data collected from internet. Moreover this is a college capstone project/prototype. To know more about project, check the project report attached below.
